I have a prior belief that given that my alarm goes off, I will oversleep with probability .08, and if my alarm doesn't go off, I will oversleep with probability .98. I also have a prior belief that my oversleeping does not have any effect on whether my classmate is late for class.\n",

If the bus is late and I don't oversleep, I will be late with probability .78. If the bus isn't late and I oversleep, I'll be late with probability .8. If the bus isn't late and I don't oversleep, I'll be late with probability .03. If the bus is late, I estimate that my classmate will be late with probability .8.
